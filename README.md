bitstarter  -- OLD REPO
==========
<h3>Stanford's Startup Engineering Project:</h3> https://www.coursera.org/course/startup

<h3>About:</h3> Spiritual sequel to Peter Thiel's CS183 course on startups. Bridges the gap between academic computer science and production software engineering. Fast-paced introduction to key tools and techniques (command line, dotfiles, text editor, distributed version control, debugging, testing, documentation, reading code, deployments), featuring guest appearances by senior engineers from successful startups and large-scale academic projects. Over the course of the class, students will build a command line application, expose it as a web service, and then link other students' applications and services together to build an HTML5 mobile app.

<h3>My Sites</h3>
I created a local preview, live staging site, and live production site using my three git branches. The production and staging sites are playgrounds for new projects but can be viewed at:<br>
http://bcooktulane-bitstarter-mooc.herokuapp.com (Heroku dyno might take a second to wake up) <br>
http://bcooktulane-bitstarter-s-mooc.herokuapp.com <br>
My staging branch evolved into something different and I wanted to preserve that project and also keep what I had in the master branch so I made a new repo bitstarter_two and a different Heroku app at <br>
